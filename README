This is a little script that configures, compiles, and installs the
kernel which the /usr/src/linux symbolic link points to. It also
generates an appropriate initramfs for this kernel using dracut (re
emerging modules if necessary), and updates the GRUB2 configuration
file.

The script assumes to be running in a Gentoo install, and that a
kernel configuration file is provided. No attempt to autoconfigure
the kernel is made.

The idea is that when the kernel is updated by portage, the user
only needs to do

   eselect kernel set <new_kernel>
   kerninst

and the script will take care of everything else.

WARNING: The script will delete the kernel, initramfs, and modules
with the same version as the kernel in /usr/src/linux; I take no
responsibility in any damage that may result by using it.
